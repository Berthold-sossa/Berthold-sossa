# Portfolio:

## 1. ADDB: Mobile app (Android and iOS)

Discovering Benin is an application which allows anyone living in or wishing to go to Benin to be able to geo-locate all institutions in Benin (Police, Hotel, Restaurant, Public Places, etc.) in one click.

The user can filter by category or search for a particular institution in order to get there using the directions provided directly in the application.

The user can also decide to make a visit to a place on a given date public in the community in order to share this moment together with other members of the community.

No need to do a thousand searches on Google before finding the next outing or event that will take place in Benin. An ‚Äúevent‚Äù filter and an events calendar ensure you never miss any events.
